My philosophy as an educator is all students are unique, and must have a `stimulating`, educational environment to grow in all areas. Every student has the right to learn in a welcoming environment. Students will be able grow intellectually, socially, and emotionally within my classroom. My goal as a teacher is to create a well-rounded `educational` environment suited to help better students in these areas. Education's purpose to me is providing knowledge and `experiences` to apply within society in their future. The needs of my students will be met within the classroom by creating an atmosphere that provokes free expression and connectedness.

As a teacher open mindedness, positive attitude, and individual performance expectations are most important. My main role within the classroom is providing the necessary resources and aid to prepare students to be successful throughout their education. I believe it is vital to incorporate `interactive` ideas and create a space that is student-centered for learning. Incorporating `hands-on` activities when possible may foster creativity, and help students better retain new information and knowledge. Students learn best when `information` is presented to them in many forms.

As a teacher, I will establish many aspects of `community` within my classroom. The aspect of a community within the classroom is important for parents as well as students. Encouraging `openness` within my classroom will also allow me to differentiate for individual students. Building `relationships` with parents and students allows for better communication, and balancing needs within the classroom.
As a teacher my biggest goal is to instill an amazing education and learning experience, that my students will cherish and build upon for the rest of their lives.
